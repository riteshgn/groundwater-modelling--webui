Instructions to build & maintain this project
========================================================================================
1. Install npm (node package manager)
    - https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
    - Recommended: use a node version manager like https://github.com/creationix/nvm

2. Project layout
    - client/src
        @ This will contain all the application specific javascript code
        @ The starting point for the code will be 'app.js'
        @ All corresponding code should be modularized and organized into logical folders.
        @ ES2015 modules must be used to import/export them.

          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export

    - public
        @ This is the final distribution which should be deployed on required environment.
        @ It will contain the index page for the SPA.
        @ It will also contain folders for js, css, fonts and images.
        @ For most parts, apart from images, contents in all other folders will be generated using webpack.

    - package.json
        @ All client-side dependencies for this project are pulled from the npm repository
          https://www.npmjs.com/
        @ This file contains all dependencies with the 'exact' version used during development.
          Make sure that this file is always up-to-date.
        @ When installing new dependencies using npm make sure to use the '--save' & '--save-exact' flags
        @ When installing a new development-only dependency make sure to use the '--save-dev' flag
        @ The 'scripts' configuration in the package.json will contain the scripts to build the
          production and development distributions for this project.
          It may also be extended in the future to start-up the dev/production web server.

    - webpack.config.json
        @ See https://webpack.js.org/concepts/

3. Material Design Bootstrap is used for the design of this project.

4. Building the distribution
    - Assumption: npm has been installed
    - Run
        npm install
    - Run
        Development : npm run build:dev
        Production  : npm run build

5. Seeing it in action
    - Serve the 'public' folder using any webserver
    - example:
        cd public/
        python -m SimpleHttpSevrer 8080
            OR
        http-server -p 8080 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
